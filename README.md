#  Little Great Minds - React Frontend

This repository contains the React-based frontend for the Little Great Minds school website, which provides information and services for parents and children aged 0 to 3 years old. It's built using:

*   **React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
*   **TypeScript:** A superset of JavaScript that adds static typing, improving code maintainability and reducing errors.
*   **Vite:** A build tool that provides a fast and efficient development experience.

## Purpose

This frontend application serves as the main website for Little Great Minds, providing information about the school, its programs, and services. It allows parents to learn more about the school, its mission, and its values, as well as get in touch with the administration.

## Key Features

*   School Overview: A brief introduction to the school, its history, and its mission.
*   Programs and Services: Information about the school's programs and services for children aged 0 to 3 years old.
*   Contact and Admission: A contact form and information about the admission process.
*   Responsive Design: A mobile-friendly design that adapts to different screen sizes and devices.
